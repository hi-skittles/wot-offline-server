<h4 align="left">I have largely left this project due to a lack of interest in WoT coupled with the fact that WG does not want/intend to release a developer API for their game. Check issues tab.</h4>

<p>Please see [this repo for any updates regarding this sort of project](https://github.com/hi-skittles/private-wot-server). It is in 0.9.7 instead of 0.9.22, as older versions are much easier to work with. Do not ask for a setup guide.</p>
